MyToken Smart Contract

OVERVIEW

The MyToken smart contract is a simple implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation of tokens with a specific name and abbreviation (symbol), and provides functionalities for minting and burning tokens.

FEATURES

Token Name: The token has a customizable name, which in this case is set to "LUBEOARD".
Token Abbreviation: The token also has a customizable abbreviation (symbol), set to "LUBE".
Total Supply: Tracks the total supply of tokens minted.
Balances Mapping: Maps addresses to token balances, allowing for balance lookup.
Minting Function: Allows for the creation of new tokens, increasing the total supply and adding tokens to the specified address.
Burning Function: Enables the destruction of tokens, decreasing the total supply and deducting tokens from the specified address, provided that the address has sufficient balance.

USAGE
1. Deploy: Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Interact: Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or other smart contracts.
3. Use the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.
4. Use the burn function to destroy existing tokens held by specific addresses.
5. Query: Query the total token supply or individual token balances using appropriate functions.
6. Customization: Customize the token name and abbreviation as per project requirements.

DISCLAIMER

Security: This smart contract is a basic implementation and may lack certain security features. It should not be used in production without thorough security audits.
Testing: Before deployment, ensure comprehensive testing to verify the correctness and robustness of the contract.
Best Practices: Follow best practices for smart contract development, including code review, testing, and adherence to standards.
